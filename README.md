## üßë‚Äçüíª Client Functionality ‚Äì Implemented by √Ålvaro Salvador

This section explains what I‚Äôve built for the PingPals client, and how you can compile and test it.

### ‚úî What I have implemented:
- A fully working TCP client in C for Windows using `winsock2.h`.
- The client connects to the server on port `9090`.
- Input and output are handled through the terminal.
- Users can type commands or plain messages and send them to the server.
- The client runs a background thread to receive messages from the server while still accepting input.
- The following commands are supported and parsed before being sent:
  - `/msg @user message` ‚Üí becomes `MSG @user message`
  - `/join #channel` ‚Üí becomes `JOIN #channel`
  - `/quit` ‚Üí disconnects from the server

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to run and test the project (step-by-step)
To test the client-server communication, follow these steps:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Open two terminals
You‚Äôll need two separate terminal windows or tabs:

One for running the server

One for running the client

You can use PowerShell, Git Bash, or VSCode‚Äôs integrated terminal.

2Ô∏è‚É£ In the first terminal (server)
Navigate to the project folder and compile the server:

gcc server/server.c -o server.exe -lws2_32

Then run the server:

./server.exe

You should see:

Server listening on port 9090...

3Ô∏è‚É£ In the second terminal (client)
Compile the client:

gcc client/client.c client/client_utils.c -o client.exe -lws2_32

Then run it:

./client.exe

You should see:

Connected to the server.
>
At this point, the client will automatically send:

HELLO FROM CLIENT

And the server will print:

Received: HELLO FROM CLIENT

4Ô∏è‚É£ (Optional) Test manual input
After that, you can also manually type any of the following commands in the client:

/msg @juan hello
/join #general
This is a test message
/quit
‚ö†Ô∏è Important:
These messages will be sent to the server, but unless the server is programmed to process them, it will just echo them back (or not respond at all).
You might not see them printed unless the server is still running and echoing back every message.

üßº If the .exe file cannot be overwritten
If you see an error like Permission denied when recompiling:

Make sure the program is not currently running

Or just compile using a new name, like:

gcc client/client.c client/client_utils.c -o client_v2.exe -lws2_32
./client_v2.exe
